# QE FAQ

## 2 PSEUDOPOTENTIALS 

A proper choice of pseudopotentials is a pre-requisite for any successful calculation. You should always test pseudopotentials on simple systems before trusting them!

### 2.1 WHERE CAN I FIND PSEUDOPOTENTIALS FOR ATOM X?
See the pseudopotential page on this web site. There you can find several tables, pointers to other tables, indications on what to do if you do not find the pseudopotential(s) you need. In case you inquire for a pseudopotential on the mailing list, please specify which kind of pseudopotential you need (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, PAW, full- or scalar-relativistic, for which XC functional, and, for many elements, with how many electrons in valence).

### 2.2 THERE ARE SO MANY PSEUDOPOTENTIALS, WHICH ONE SHOULD I CHOOSE?
Those that fit your needs in terms of transferability and computational efficiency, for the calculations you want to perform. Choosing good pseudopotentials is an important part of an electronic-structure calculation. Are you sure you really like somebody else do this for you? Please have a look at the various links and resources of the pseudopotential page.

### 2.3 CAN I MIX USPP/NCPP/PAW ?
Yes, you can (when possible, of course: a few kinds of calculations are not available with USPP, a few more are not for PAW). A small restrictions exists in cp.x, expecting atoms with USPP listed before those with NCPP, which in turn are expected before local PP’s (if any). A further restriction, that can be overridden, is that all PP’s should be generated with the same XC. Otherwise, you can mix and match. Note that it is the hardest atom that determines the cutoff.

### 2.4 MY TOTAL ENERGY DEPENDS UPON THE PSEUDOPOTENTIAL!
That’s correct: absolute energies depend upon the kind of pseudopotential(s) used. Only energy differences are physically relevant. Differences in absolute energies may be especially large if you compare pseudopotentials with different number of electrons.

### 2.5 WHERE CAN I FIND PSEUDOPOTENTIALS FOR RARE-EARTH X?
Please consider first if DFT is suitable for your system! In many cases, it isn’t (at least “plain” DFT: GGA and the like). If you are still convinced that it is, see above.

### 2.6 IS THERE A CONVERTER FROM FORMAT XYZ TO UPF, OR VICE VERSA?
What is available (no warranty) is in directory upftools/. You are most welcome to contribute a new converter.

### 2.7 WHERE CAN I FIND PSEUDOPOTENTIAIS FOR HYBRID/NONLOCAL FUNCTIONALS?
Short answer: nowhere, for the time being. Use pseudopotentials for the non-hybrid functional that is closer to the hybrid you like: PBE for PBE0 and HSE, BLYP for B3LYP. Same for nonlocal (e.g. vdw-DF) functionals: use pseudopotentials generated for the closest GGA functional.

## 3 INPUT DATA

A large percentage of the problems reported to the mailing list are caused by incorrect input data. Before reporting a problem with strange crashes or strange results, please have a look at your structure with XCrySDen (or another visualization software). XCrySDen can directly visualize the structure from both PWscf input data:

`xcrysden --pwi "input-data-file"`
and from PWscf output as well:

`xcrysden --pwo "output-file"`

Unlike most other visualizers, XCrySDen is periodicity-aware: you can easily visualize periodically repeated cells. You are advised to always use XCrySDen to check your input data!

### 3.1 DOES QE USE PRIMITIVE OR CONVENTIONAL UNIT CELL? ALL ATOM OR SYMMETRY-INEQUIVALENT ONES?
QE uses all atoms and the primitive unit cell. If you want to use the so-called “conventional” unit cell, you are free to do it, as long as you specify both the cell parameters and the atomic positions correctly.

### 3.2 WHERE CAN I FIND THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE/ATOMIC POSITIONS OF XYZ?
Check the Library of Crystallographic Prototypes. The American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database is another excellent place to find structures, though you will have to use it in conjunction with the Bilbao crystallography server, and have some understanding of space groups and Wyckoff positions. Another interesting site: http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx/index.html. (most info here from Mike Mehl).

CIF files can be converted to using the PW/tools/pw2cif.sh script, courtesy of Carlo Nervi, or
using gdis v. 0.99 and later: Open CIF file with gdis and then save as ‘filename.pwi’. The code understands the extension ‘pwi’ and prepare a simple input file for Quantum ESPRESSO (info by Mutlu Colakogullari)

### 3.3 MY CRYSTAL HAS A 4_H_2131C STRUCTURE, HOW DOES THIS TRANSLATE TO QE INPUT DATA?
There are several different ways to specify structures, described in detail in Doc/INPUT_PW.*. Please choose the one that better fits your needs. You can select your lattice from a list Bravais lattices; or you can specify crystallographic parameters a,b,c,cos(ab), cos(ac), cos(bc); or you can provide the three primitive lattice vectors. You can provide atomic positions in units of the primitive lattice vectors, or in cartesian axis and Bohr radii / A /units of the lattice parameter a.

### 3.4 HOW CAN I GENERATE A SUPERCELL?
If you need to create a supercell and are too lazy to create a small program to translate atoms, or to do it manually, you can use one of the following codes:

```
XCrySDen (suggested by G. Mattioli)
gaussview, or Avogadro (suggested by A. Shearer)
use the VESTA program, it’s a beatiful and friendly program to see crystal structures and make supercell, this program save the atomic positions in XYZ format. Furthermore, runs on linux and win! (Arles V. Gil Rebaza)
Utility “genlat.f” of DL_POLY (suggested by G. Lapenna)
use the ‘spacegroup’ program in EXCITING package (http://exciting-code.org) to generate the supercell, use ‘fropho’ (http://fropho.sourceforge.net) to check the symmetry’ (Kun Yin, April 2009)
use the PHON code: http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfbdxa/ (Eyvaz Isaev, April 2009).
```

### 3.5 WHERE CAN I FIND THE BRILLOUIN ZONE/HIGH-SYMMETRY POINTS/IRREPS FOR XYZ?
You might find this web site useful: http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/getkvec.html (info by Cyrille Barreteau, nov. 2007). Or else: in textbooks, such as e.g. The mathematical theory of symmetry in solids by Bradley and Cracknell.

### 3.6 WHERE CAN I FIND MONKHORST-PACK GRIDS OF K-POINTS?
Auxiliary code kpoints.x, found in pwtools/ and produced by make tools, generates uniform grids of k-points that are equivalent to Monkhorst-Pack grids.

### 3.7 HOW DO I FORCE A GIVEN OCCUPANCY ON A GIVEN ATOM?
Short answer: you cannot. See this tutorial if you want to convince two atoms of the same kind to have different oxidation states.

### 3.8 WHAT ARE THE ATOMIC POSITIONS/K-POINTS FOR GRAPHENE?
Here two examples out of the many ways to provide input data for a perfect graphene layer:
```
&system  
ibrav= 4, celldm(1) =4.6542890, celldm(3)=something appropriate, nat= 2, ntyp= 1, [...]

## 4 PARALLEL EXECUTION

Effective usage of parallelism requires some basic understanding on how parallel machines work and how parallelism is implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO. If you have no experience and no clear ideas (or not idea at all), consider reading Sec.3 of the User Guide.

### 4.1 HOW DO I CHOOSE THE NUMBER OF PROCESSORS/HOW DO I SETUP MY PARALLEL CALCULATION?
Optimizing the parallel execution requires a basic understanding of the parallelism, how calculations are parallelized in Quantum ESPRESSO, and the specifics (size, k-points, etc.) of the system at hand. Please start by reading carefully Sec. 3 of the user guide, and compare your use case with some of the examples given in the documentation.

### 4.2 WHY IS MY PARALLEL JOB RUNNING IN SUCH A LOUSY WAY?
Very often people has unrealistic expectations on the scaling of electronic-structure calculations. You can achieve good scaling only with a judicious choice of the various parallelization levels and if you have appropriate communication hardware, and only for a restricted range of processors and for sufficiently large calculations. Very lousy scaling (e.g. much slower in parallel than in serial) may point instead to memory conflicts (not all parallelization leveles distribute memory!) or MPI-OpenMP conflicts caused by libraries (the most infamous case being MKL in the past).

### 4.3 WHY IS MY PARALLEL JOB STOPPING WITH AN _ERROR READING NAMELIST XXXX_?
See item 5.9 of this FAQ. If the problem seems to arise only for parallel execution, i.e. the same input is accepted when running on a single processor, see next item.

### 4.4 WHY IS MY PARALLEL JOB NOT READING THE SAME INPUT DATA THAT WORKS FOR SERIAL JOBS?
Use "mycode -inp input_file" instead of "mycode < input_file". Some MPI libraries do not properly handle input redirection.

### 4.5 WHY IS MY PARALLEL JOB NOT RUNNING ON N PROCESSORS BUT JUST ON ONE?
First of all, verify the syntax of your MPI launcher (mpirun, mpiexec, or whatever you use). If correct, look at the header of the output file:

if it says serial compilation, your “parallel” code is not parallel and you are running N copies of it;

if it says parallel (…) compilation, but running on 1 procs, there is typically a mismatch between the MPI libraries you have used in the compilation and the MPI launcher you are actually using. This may happen on machines with different (e.g. MPICH and OpenMPI) parallel environments installed.

## 5 FREQUENT ERRORS DURING EXECUTION

### 5.1 WHAT DO ERRORS LIKE “FORRTL: SEVERE (59): LIST-DIRECTED I/O SYNTAX ERROR, UNIT 5, FILE STDIN” MEAN?

“forrtl” = fortran run-time library (so it is a fortran error)

“list-directed I/O syntax error” = there was an error while reading or writing (see below)

“unit 5″ = fortran unit (5 is typically used to read input data)

“stdin” = standard input (i.e. terminal input, or redirection)

Typical case: you are reading data from terminal or from file like this: \"code < data-file", and there is an error in what you typed or in "data-file". Sometimes it is not easy to spot the error (see also answer 5.9 below) but input parsing errors are almost invariably due to an error or an unexpected character in the input. An exception might be the case of parallel execution, see Item 4.4 in this FAQ.

### 5.2 WHY IS MY JOB CRASHING WITH “SEGMENTATION FAULT”?
Possible reasons: too much memory requested; executable or mathematical libraries compiled for a different hardware; some incompatibility between compiler and mathematical libraries; flaky hardware; bug in compiler or in mathematical libraries. The latter two are typically not reproducible on different architectures or compilers; code bugs may sometimes be elusive, but typically yield a more reproducible pattern of problems. Segmentation faults in tests and examples almost invariably point to a problem in the compiler or in the mathematical libraries or in their interactions.

Mysterious, unpredictable, erratic errors in parallel execution are almost always coming from bugs in the compiler or/and in the MPI libraries and sometimes even from flaky hardware. Sorry, not our fault.

### 5.3 THE CODE STOPS WITH A MYSTERIOUS ERROR IN IOTK
IOTK is a toolkit that reads/writes XML files. There are frequent reports (especially when compling with gfortran and MKL libraries) of mysterious errors with IOTK not finding some variable in the XML data file. If this error has no obvious explanation (e.g. the file is properly written and read, the searched variable is present, etc) and if it appears to be erratic or irreproducible (e.g. it occurs only with version X of compiler Y), it is almost certainly due to a compiler bug. Try to reduce optimization level, or use a different compiler. If you paid real money for your compiler, complain with the vendor.

### 5.4 THE CODE STOPS WITH AN “ERROR IN DAVCIO”
davcio is a routine that reads from/writes to disk. The error number is what the I/O operation returns, so it means little more than “there was an error”. Possible reasons: disk is full; outdir is not writable for any reason; you run post-processing codes on a number of processors/pools that are not the same used to produce the pw.x data (and did not set variable wf_collect); you made a mess with your data files and directories; your data files are corrupted; you were running more than one instance of pw.x in the same temporary directory with the same file names.

### 5.5 WHY IS THE CODE SAYING “WRONG ATOMIC COORDINATES”?
Because they are: two or more atoms in the list of atoms have overlapping, or anyway too close, positions. Can’t you see why? look better (or use a molecular viewer like XCrySDen) and remember that the code checks periodic images as well.

### 5.6 THE CODE STOPS WITH A “WRONG CHARGE” ERROR
Typically, you are treating a metallic system as if it were insulating. Use a gaussian smearing.

### 5.7 THE CODE STOPS WITH AN “ERROR IN CDIAGHG” OR “IN RDIAGHG”
This is a tough case. It signals that the Hamiltonian, or the overlap matrix, calculated in the subspace of occupied + correction states (used in iterative diagonalization), is singular. This should however never happen, unless: 1) the atomic positions are seriously wrong (e.g. too close), or 2) the pseudopotentials are bad, or not so good. The latter case typically happens with Ultrasoft PP. When the error is erratic and irreproducible on other machines, it may be related to mathematical libraries of questionable accuracy. If you are out of ideas, try option “diagonalization=’cg’ “.

### 5.8 THE CODE STOPS WITH AN ERROR IN ROUTINE “SCALE_H”
During a variable-cell structural optimization (“vc-relax”) you may get the following error:

```
Error in routine scale_h (1):
Not enough space allocated for radial FFT: try restarting with a larger cellfactor.
```

This is a consequence of a too small starting unit cell. If the cell expands too much, the number of plane waves and of G-vectors increases and may eventually exceed the length of arrays allocated at the beginning. Increase the value of optional variable “cell_factor”, or restart from a larger cell.

### 5.9 THE CODE STOPS WITH _ERROR READING NAMELIST XXX_
Misspelled variable in namelist XXX, or properly-spelled variable set to an illegal value (e.g. an integer variable to a real value). Also: unexpected characters, such as DOS CR-LF characters, ‘curly’ quotes instead of ‘straight’ quotes, in the file, or comments introduced by “#” (only “!” is allowed inside namelists). Also: if the input file is empty, you get an error while reading the first namelist, typically “&control”. For the parallel case, see items 4.3 and 4.4 of these FAQs.
